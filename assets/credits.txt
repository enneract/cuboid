    NAME

Cuboid - a Tremulous 1.2 mod focused on cuboids and fixing balance issues.

    CHANGELOG

Version  Release date
______________________________________________________________________________________________
0.1.6    Jan 19 2013
GAMEPLAY:
- Introduced the Basivision (Activate Upgrade, +button2). While enabled, Basilisks can see in dark and see humans and their buildings through walls.
- Zap damage was corrected.
- Admins can choose to limit the maximum health for cuboids (g_cuboidHealthLimit).
- Lava and slime now deal damage smoothly.
- Reworked the jumping-out-of-water system: Tyrants and Dragoons should now be able to exit water easily.
- Dretches, Basislisk and Tyrants are no longer calculated as "out of water" if on the bottom of a liquid tank (removes a lot of exploits, notably walking on the bottom of Ancient Remains lava pool).
- Non-cuboids that haven't finished building are no longer removed after builder's death.
NON-GAMEPLAY:
- Various new images, particle systems and sounds.
- Cleaned up the cuboid protocol (thing responsible for the green/yellow/red preview while placing a cuboid).
- One of the loading bars no longer stops at 75%.
- Announcer can be disabled (cg_announcer or the Options menu).
- Turret angles are now interpolated (smooth).
- Removed the mod tutorial system (which didn't work at all).
- /register now forces a write to disk after registering. The server should no longer "forget" about registrations.
- New weapon.cfg weapon mode keyword: "impactMarkAlphaFade" - if it's defined, the weapon's impact mark fades out using alpha compositing (so it can properly fade out alphaFunc shaders).
- Added camera shake effect near explosions (magnitude controlled by cg_cameraShakeMagnitude, set to 0 to disable).
- Added /cuboidSize <x> <y> <z> which makes it possible to resize the cuboid via console commands.

0.1.5    Sep 12 2013
GAMEPLAY:
- Reverted both Lucifer Cannon and Advanced Marauder zap back to the GPP state.
- Increased Jetpack jump fuel usage from 85 to 300 (up to 20 jumps instead of 70).
- Health cross changes icon and color when implanted with an egg.
NON-GAMEPLAY:
- Proper Helmet Mk2 model and texture.

0.1.4    Sep 12 2013
NON-GAMEPLAY:
- Announcer now announces things like "Aliens win" or "1 minute remaining", not just votes.
- /register was implemented
- Admin titles were implemented (/settitle, /listplayers).
- Death obituaries were improved (now show killer's health and victim's class (if alien)).

0.1.3    Sep 10 2013
GAMEPLAY:
- It's no longer possible to avoid buildtimer by reconnecting.
NON-GAMEPLAY:
- Customizable vote percentages: g_[map/restart/draw]VotePercent, default: 67.
- Customizable vote timelimits: g_[map/restart]Timelimit, default: 5 for map votes, 10 for restart votes.
- A lot of visual changes in the voting system.
- Added vote sounds.

0.1.2    Sep 09 2013
GAMEPLAY:
- Wall impact effects no longer appear on players or buildables (the MD passing through players bug).
- Now it takes longer for Biores to start healing after the human is hurt.
NON-GAMEPLAY:
- Added a death obituary for being killed with a rantbomb.
- Replaced Turret spinup sound.
- Turrets now play a sound after killing their target.
- It's now possible to change the resizing speed for cuboids (via menu or cg.cuboidResizeRate).
- Scoretable now displays high amounts of score properly.

0.1.1    Sep 07 2013
GAMEPLAY:
- Rebalanced Cuboids.
- Advanced Marauder damage to buildables lowered by 33%.
- Decreased jump stamina take by 40% (it's now possible to perform ca. 66% more jumps without replenishing stamina).
- Limited the amount of Defense Computers that can simultaneously heal a single buildable.
- Non-repairable cuboids (like concrete or glass) can no longer be healed by Defense Computers.
NON-GAMEPLAY:
- Added missing Human Impregnation Mod assets.
- Updated Helmet Mk2's texture (still not final).
- Cleaned up assets.

0.1.0    Sep 06 2013
GAMEPLAY:
- Based upon Cuboid 0.2.2 (note: the versioning in the original cuboid was different).
- Added Human Impregnation Mod.
- Jetpacks now need fuel to operate (buy ammo to refuel).
- Added a Jetpack fuel indicator (cg_fuelInfo* cvars to customize).
- Jumping uses fuel instead of stamina when possible (jetpack jumps).
- Implemented CPMA physics for everyone (both teams, all classes).
- Lucifer Cannon behaviour reverted to 1.1 (slow missiles, high firerate).
- Knockback values of Tesla Generators, Flame Throwers and Hives were decrased greatly 
- Aliens now build faster than Humans (all buildables).
- It is now possible to evolve near an enemy as long as he's not in the sight.
- Adv. Marauder now works like Quake 3's Lightning Gun (greatly increased fire rate, damage per second remains unchanged).
- Medkit now gives humans 15s long immunity to poison.
- Dodging was removed.
- Dragoon pounce damage lowered by 25%.
- Trample damage lowered by 33%.
- Added Biores (heals the user and grants a partial immunity to poison).
- Server operator can choose to limit the amount of buildings that can be built in an area
- Tyrants can drop bombs (regenerate at a Booster)
- Updated the tutorial system - now it turns itself on every update but displays help only about things that weren't in the last version
- A splash screen (with Cuboid logo and version) is now displayed every map load/restart. 
- Regular Helmet was renamed to Helmet Mk2 and Helmet Mk1 was added (a weaker, Stage 1 version).
NON-GAMEPLAY:
- Jetpack now has new, less annoying sounds.
- Flamer sounds better.
- New Marauder zapping sounds.
